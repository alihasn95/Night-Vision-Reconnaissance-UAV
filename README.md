The overall system consists of a LiPo battery feeding a voltage regulator, which powers a  PIC18F46K22 flight controller. The controller interfaces with an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module  for live video streaming and remote commands. An IMU (GY-521), a thermal camera,  and a night-vision camera feed sensory data to the controller.
